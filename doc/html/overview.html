<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This document was adapted from the following paper:
Droettboom, M., MacMillan, K., and Fujinaga, I. 2003. <em>The Gamera
framework for building custom recognition systems</em>. In proceedings,
Symposium on Document Image Understanding Technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-1">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Gamera is a framework for the creation of structured document analysis
applications by domain experts. Domain experts are individuals who
have a strong knowledge of the documents in a collection, but may not
have a formal technical background. The goal is to create a tool that
leverages their knowledge of the target documents to create custom
applications rather than attempting to meet diverse requirements with
a monolithic application.</p>
<p>This paper gives an overview of the architecture and design principles
of Gamera.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="architecture-overview">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-2">Architecture overview</a></h1>
<p>Developing recognition systems for difficult historical documents
requires experimentation since the solution is often
non-obvious. Therefore, Gamera's primary goal is to support an
efficient test-and-refine development cycle. Virtually every
implementation detail is driven by this goal. For instance, Python
<a class="citation-reference" href="#rossum2002" id="citation-reference-1">[Rossum2002]</a> was chosen as the core language because of its
introspection capabilities, dynamic typing and ease of use. It has
been used as a first programming language with considerable success
<a class="citation-reference" href="#berehzny2001" id="citation-reference-2">[Berehzny2001]</a>. C++ is used to write plugins where runtime performance
is a priority, but even in that case, the <a class="reference external" href="writing_plugins.html">Gamera plugin system</a> is
designed to make writing extensions as easy as possible. Gamera
includes a full-fledged graphical user interface that provides a
number of shortcuts for training, as well as inspection of the results
of algorithms at every step. By improving the ease of experimentation,
we hope to put the power to develop recognition systems with those who
understand the documents best. We expect at least two kinds of
developers to work with the system: those with a technical background
adding algorithms to the system, and those working on the higher-level
aggregation of those pieces. It is important to note this distinction,
since those groups represent different skill sets and requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to its support of test-and-refine development, Gamera also
has several other advantages that are important to large-scale
digitization projects in general. These are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Open source code</strong> and <strong>standards-compliance</strong> so that the software
can interact well with other parts of a digitization framework</li>
<li><strong>Platform independence</strong>, running on a variety of operating systems
including Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS-X</li>
<li><strong>A workflow system</strong> to combine high-level tasks</li>
<li><strong>Batch processing</strong></li>
<li><strong>A unit-testing framework</strong> to ensure correctness and avoid regression</li>
<li><strong>User interface components</strong> for development and classifier training</li>
<li><strong>Recognition confidence output</strong> so that collection managers can
easily target documents that need correction or different
recognition strategies</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="section" id="tasks">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-3">Tasks</a></h2>
<p>Gamera has a modular plugin architecture. These modules typically
perform one of five document recognition tasks:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Pre-processing</li>
<li>Document segmentation and analysis</li>
<li>Symbol segmentation and classification</li>
<li>Syntactical or structural analysis</li>
<li>Output</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of these tasks can be arbitrarily complex, involve multiple
strategies or modules, or be removed entirely depending on the
specific recognition problem at hand. The actual steps that make up a
complete recognition system are completely controlled by the user.</p>
<div class="section" id="pre-processing">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-4">Pre-processing</a></h3>
<p>Pre-processing involves standard image-processing operations such as
noise removal, blurring, de-skewing, contrast adjustment, sharpening,
binarization, and morphology. Close attention to and refinement of
these steps is particularly important when working with degraded
historical documents.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="document-segmentation-and-analysis">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-5">Document segmentation and analysis</a></h3>
<p>Before the symbols of a document can be classified, an analysis of the
overall structure of the document may be necessary. The purpose of
this step is to analyze the structure of the document, segment it into
sections, and perhaps identify and remove elements. For example, in
the case of music recognition, it is necessary to identify and remove
the staff lines in order to be able to properly separate the
individual symbols. Similarly, text documents may require the removal
of figures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="symbol-segmentation-and-classification">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-6">Symbol segmentation and classification</a></h3>
<p>The segmentation, feature extraction, and classification of symbols is
the core of the Gamera system. The system allows different segmenters
and classifiers to be plugged-in.</p>
<p>Classifiers come in two flavors: &quot;interactive&quot; classifiers, where
examples can be added and the results tested immediately, and
&quot;non-interactive&quot; classifiers, that are highly optimized but
static. Gamera has a generic and flexible <a class="reference external" href="xml_format.html">XML-based file format</a> to
store classifier data, but for efficiency, the &quot;non-interactive&quot;
classifiers can also define their own format containing Pre-parsed or
pre-optimized data. At present, we have an implementation of the k
-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm <a class="citation-reference" href="#cover1967" id="citation-reference-3">[Cover1967]</a> whose selections and weights
can be optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) <a class="citation-reference" href="#holland1975" id="citation-reference-4">[Holland1975]</a>. We have tested
the extensibility of our classifier framework by porting a simple
back-propagating neural network library to Gamera
<a class="citation-reference" href="#schemenauer2002" id="citation-reference-5">[Schemenauer2002]</a>. We also plan to examine what modifications would be
necessary to support stateful classifiers, such as hidden Markov
models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="syntactical-and-structural-analysis">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-7">Syntactical and structural analysis</a></h3>
<p>This process reconstructs a document into a semantic representation of
the individual symbols. Examples of this include combining stems,
flags, and noteheads into musical objects, or grouping words and
numbers into lines, paragraphs, columns etc. Obviously, this process
is entirely dependent on the type of document being processed and is a
likely place for large customizations by knowledgeable users.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="output">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-8">Output</a></h3>
<p>Gamera stores groups of glyphs in an <a class="reference external" href="xml_format.html">XML-based file format</a>. This
makes it very easy to save, load, and merge sets of training
data. Since a run-length encoded copy of the glyph is included, it is
easy to load the original images and inspect, edit or generate new
features from them.</p>

<div class="section" id="graphical-user-interface">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-9">Graphical user interface</a></h1>
<p>Since document recognition is an inherently visual problem, a
graphical user interface (GUI) is included to allow the application
developer to experiment with different recognition strategies. At the
core of the interface is the console window which allows the
programmer to run code interactively and control the system either by
typing commands or using menus. All commands are recorded in a
history, which can later be used for building automatic batch scripts.</p>
<blockquote>
<!-- image: images/console.png -->
</blockquote>
<p>The interface also includes a simple image viewer, image analysis
tools, and a training interface for the learning classifiers.</p>
<blockquote>
<!-- image: images/classifier_window.png -->
</blockquote>
<p>The training interface allows the user to create databases of labeled
glyphs, including the merging and splitting of connected components.</p>
<p>The interface can easily be extended to include new elements as
modules are added to Gamera. The entire GUI is written in Python,
using the wxPython toolkit.</p>
<p>The Gamera GUI documentation contains more information.</p>

<div class="section" id="image-classes">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-11">Image classes</a></h2>
<p>The storage and manipulation of images is one of the most important
aspects of Gamera. Gamera must provide not only general-purpose image
manipulation functions, but also infrastructure to support the symbol
segmentation and analysis. The features of the Image classes in Gamera
include:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Polymorphic image types.</strong></dt>
<dd>Gamera images can be in stored using a number of different pixel
types, including color (24-bit RGB), greyscale (8- and 16-bit),
floating point (32-bit) and bi-level images, though new images
types can be added as desired.</dd>
<dt><strong>Consistent programming interface.</strong></dt>
<dd>The interface to all types of images (in both C++ and Python) is
the same. While some methods are not available for all image types
(e.g. thresholding a bi-level image would not make sense), in many
cases image types are interchangeable, meaning types can be
changed at different points in the development process.</dd>
<dt><strong>Use of existing code libraries.</strong></dt>
<dd>The image classes have been designed especially to make
transferring code from other ccpp image processing libraries as
easy as possible. For example, many algorithms in the VIGRA
library <a class="citation-reference" href="#jahne1999" id="citation-reference-6">[Jähne1999]</a> can be used in Gamera without
modification. Using C libraries, such as XITE <a class="citation-reference" href="#boe1998" id="citation-reference-7">[Bøe1998]</a>, often
requires only a few minor modifications of the code. This ability
has reduced our development time considerably.</dd>
<dt><strong>Portions of images.</strong></dt>
<dd>The image classes allow for the flexible and efficient
representation of portions of images, including non-rectangular
regions, without resorting to memory copying. The bi-level images
actually store 16-bits-per-pixel, so that labeling information can
be stored to define connected components. This uses a considerably
smaller memory footprint than using separate data for each
connected component.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="image_types.html">image types documentation</a> contains more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-plugin-system">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-12">The plugin system</a></h2>
<p>Writing wrapper code to call C/C++ from Python is a time-consuming,
error-prone and repetitive task. A number of general-purpose tools
exist to help automate this process, including <a class="reference external" href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost
Python</a>. In fact, an earlier version of Gamera used Boost Python, but
the additional function-call overhead for our highly polymorphic image
types lead to poor performance of that system as a whole. We have
since developed our own wrapper-generating mechanism specific to
Gamera and its classes. This allowed us to provide optimizations and
conveniences to the programmer that would not be possible with a more
general approach.</p>
<p>To add a plugin function to Gamera, a programmer writes metadata about
the function (in Python) and a single function to perform an
image-processing task (in C++). Plugin functions are grouped into
standard Python modules, which are collections of related classes and
functions.</p>
