<p>This tutorial walks through the process of creating training data
using the Gamera GUI.  The training GUI is designed to be as flexible
as possible, so this tutorial represents just one possible approach,
while introducing most of the key features and concepts.</p>
<p>For this example, we will be training on pages from the
<a class="reference external" href="http://edina.ac.uk/statacc/">Statistical Accounts of Scotland</a>.  The demo pages used in this
tutorial will be made available through the Gamera website soon.</p>
<p>The goal during the run of this tutorial is to create enough training
data that the classifier will perform well on new pages.</p>
<div class="section" id="starting-the-gui">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-1">Starting the GUI</a></h1>
<p>There is a <tt class="docutils literal">gamera_gui</tt> script installed somewhere on your system
(this location is platform-specific, see <a class="reference external" href="install.html">Building and Installing
Gamera</a>).  Run it to start the Gamera GUI.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="console-window">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-2">Console window</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<img alt="images/tutorial_console.png" src="images/tutorial_console.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>The first thing displayed is the console window.  It won't be used for
anything in this tutorial, other than starting up the classifier
interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="classifier-window">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-3">Classifier window</a></h1>
<p>From the console window, start the interactive classifier window.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Classify -&gt; Interactive Classifier</strong></blockquote>
<p>When prompted for a name for the result, simply click
<strong>Ok</strong> to accept the default.  This will open an empty classifier window.</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="images/tutorial_classifier_window.png" src="images/tutorial_classifier_window.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>The classifier window always starts from a clean slate: there is no
data in the classifier and it does not yet have an image to use as a
source.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="opening-and-segmenting-an-image">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-4">Opening and segmenting an image</a></h1>
<p>First, load a page image.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Image -&gt; Open and segment image...</strong></blockquote>
<p>This loads an image into the training interface, segments it into its
parts, and then puts those parts into the page glyphs pane in the
training interface.</p>
<p>The method used to segment the image into its parts is user-selectable,
and will depend on the type of documents being trained.  For instance,
if the document were sheet music, the segmenter would need to first
remove the staff lines.  Most often you will use the default
segmentation method, connected component analysis (<tt class="docutils literal">cc_analysis</tt>),
which will separate all of the contiguous groups of black pixels on the
page.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, select the filename for the first page
and use the default segmentation method <tt class="docutils literal">cc_analysis</tt>.</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="images/tutorial_open_and_segment_image.png" src="images/tutorial_open_and_segment_image.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>When the page has been loaded, the connected components will be
displayed in the <strong>Page glyphs</strong> pane (upper right), and the original
image will be in the pane below.</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="images/tutorial_starting_training.png" src="images/tutorial_starting_training.png" />
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="selecting-glyphs">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-5">Selecting glyphs</a></h1>
<p>Glyphs can be selected in a number of ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>By clicking and dragging across cells in the page glyphs pane.</li>
<li>By clicking on glyphs in the original image display.</li>
<li>By dragging a bounding box around glyphs in the original image display.</li>
<li>Adding/removing glyphs from the selection by selecting while
holding down the <strong>Shift</strong> key.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The selection in the page glyphs pane and on the original image are
automatically synchronized.  The status bar displayed the number of
selected glyphs.</p>
<p>Experiment with the different selection methods to get a feel for the
interface.</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="images/tutorial_selection.png" src="images/tutorial_selection.png" />
<img alt="images/tutorial_selection2.png" src="images/tutorial_selection2.png" />
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="beginning-training">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-6">Beginning training</a></h1>
<p>Now, to begin training.  Training is simply the act of assigning
names to each of the glyphs.  In Gamera, these names are made up of
dot-delimited tokens.  (See <a class="reference external" href="gui.html#class-names">class names</a>.)</p>
<p>To see what's happening behind the scenes as we're training, open the
<strong>Classifier glyphs</strong> pane by pressing the <strong>+</strong> button in the <strong>Page
glyphs</strong> title bar.</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="images/tutorial_classifier_glyphs_pane.png" src="images/tutorial_classifier_glyphs_pane.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>Since the example being used for this tutorial is text, the characters
will be named to conform to Unicode character names.  This will allow
class names to conveniently map to characters when OCR is output from
a Gamera-based system.  In Unicode, the character name for <tt class="docutils literal">A</tt> is
<tt class="docutils literal">LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A</tt> and for <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">LATIN SMALL LETTER A</tt>
etc..  To fit these names into Gamera's naming convention, they can be
adapted to <tt class="docutils literal">latin.capital.letter.a</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">latin.small.letter.a</tt>.
Of course, for non-textual documents, a different naming convention
may have to be devised.</p>
<p>The page glyphs are sorted roughly by size.  The first few glyphs are
generally specks of dust or bits of broken characters on the page.
It's generally easiest to start with the glyphs that make up whole
characters and then deal with the broken characters later.</p>
<p>To classify a glyph, select it, type its name and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>For this example, scroll down to where the first few legitimate
characters appear.  In the example below, the <tt class="docutils literal">w</tt> was selected, then
<tt class="docutils literal">latin.small.letter.w</tt> was entered, followed by <strong>Enter</strong> to confirm
the classification.</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="images/tutorial_first_character.png" src="images/tutorial_first_character.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the following things happen upon manual classification:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Most importantly, the glyph is added to the classifier (as shown
by its appearance in the classifier glyphs pane).</li>
<li>The glyph changes color to green, which indicates that it was
classified by a human trainer.</li>
<li>The class name is added to the tree of class names on the left.</li>
<li>The status bar at the bottom is updated to show how many glyphs
are in the classifier.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bootstrap the classifier by continuing in this fashion for
a dozen or more characters.  If you make a mistake, you can simply
reselect the glyph and give it a new class name.  Note that you can
also select multiple glyphs and train them in one step, as illustrated
in the following picture.</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="images/tutorial_more_training.png" src="images/tutorial_more_training.png" />
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-auto-move">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-7">Using auto-move</a></h1>
<p>Of course, continuing to train in this fashion gets tedious and
involves a lot of &quot;mousing around&quot;.  The <strong>auto-move</strong> mode will
automatically move to the next glyph after each glyph is trained.  It
will also guess the class of unclassified symbols automatically,
meaning the trainer only needs to confirm or correct the classifier's
guess.</p>
<p>Turn on <strong>auto-move</strong> mode by clicking the</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="images/icon_next_unclass.png" src="images/icon_next_unclass.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>toolbar button.  When this button is toggled on, the training
interface will automatically move to the next unclassified (white)
glyph after each manual classification is made.</p>
<p>To try it out, select an unclassified glyph to start with.  Type its
class name and press <strong>Enter</strong>.  The selection will automatically move
to the next unclassified glyph, with a &quot;guess&quot; displayed in a box
underneath the glyph and automatically entered in the textbox in the upper
left.  If this guess is correct, simply press <strong>Enter</strong> to confirm and
add the glyph to the classifier with that class name.  If the guess is
incorrect, it may be edited and then submitted by pressing <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="images/tutorial_auto_move.png" src="images/tutorial_auto_move.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>Other useful keystrokes while in <strong>auto-move</strong> mode are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>F12</strong>: Skip the currently selected glyph and move on to the next</dt>
<dd>one.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><strong>F11</strong>: Back up one glyph to reclassify.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also useful to close the <strong>Classifier glyphs</strong> pane to increase
training speed.</p>
<p>With <strong>auto-move</strong> mode and these keystrokes, it is possible to train
quite efficiently by keeping one's hands on the keyboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="training-broken-characters">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-8">Training broken characters</a></h1>
<p>Occasionally, characters will be broken into multiple glyphs,
either because the ink has degraded or the imaging is
poor.  Also, it may be that the character itself is intentionally
broken, such as the lower case <em>i</em>.</p>
<p>For these cases, in the original image display, drag a bounding box
around the connected components that make up the character.  (It may
be useful to zoom in on the image.)  Then train the collection with a
class name beginning with <tt class="docutils literal">_group.</tt>.</p>
<p>For instance, in the following example, the parts that make up the
letter <tt class="docutils literal">N</tt> are selected, and then trained as
<tt class="docutils literal">_group.latin.capital.letter.n</tt>.</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="images/tutorial_grouping.png" src="images/tutorial_grouping.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>The union of the parts will be stored as a single glyph in the training
dataset. Note that when you later in the recognition stage want to recognize
glyphs that are broken, intentionally like the letter &quot;i&quot; or unintentionally,
you must use the <tt class="docutils literal">group_list_automatic</tt> classifier method.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="saving-the-training-data">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-9">Saving the training data</a></h1>
<p>It is good practice to regularly save the training data.  Use the menu
item</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>File -&gt; Classifier glyphs -&gt; Save glyphs in classifier...</strong></blockquote>
<p>to save the training data.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">There is no auto-save feature, so be sure to save your work
often.</p>
</div>
<p>Once the entire page has been classified, save it to a file called
<tt class="docutils literal">tutorial_page1.xml</tt>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you don't want to take the time to train
the entire page, you can load this training data from the
tutorial using the menu option <strong>File -&gt; Classifier glyphs
-&gt; Open glyphs into classifier...</strong> and selecting
<tt class="docutils literal">tutorial_page1.xml</tt>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-to-the-second-page">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-10">On to the second page</a></h1>
<p>Once the first page has been trained, the next page can be loaded in
by using</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Image -&gt; Open and segment image...</strong></blockquote>
<p>Note that the <strong>page glyphs</strong> have been replaced with the contents of
the new page, but the <strong>classifier glyphs</strong> (the training data)
remains the same.</p>
<p>Since there is already some training data in the classifier, it won't
need to be bootstrapped as it was for the first page.  The existing
classifier data can be used to classify the second page, and then the
user can go through and correct the classifier's mistakes.</p>
<p>To run the classifier over the <strong>page glyphs</strong>, use the menu option</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Classifier -&gt; Group and guess all</strong>.</blockquote>
<p>After some time, all of the glyphs on the page will have been
classified, and grouped if necessary.  Note that the automatically
classified glyphs are displayed in red.  The glyphs on the page will
be sorted by their class name.  Within each class name it is fairly
easy to scan for incorrectly identified symbols.  Note that the glyphs
within each class name are sorted by decreasing confidence.  Often the
glyphs near the beginning will appear more like the training data and
the glyphs near the end will be more unlike the training data.</p>
<blockquote>
<img alt="images/tutorial_second_page.png" src="images/tutorial_second_page.png" />
</blockquote>
<p>Once going through and correcting all of the classifier's mistakes, it
is good practice to &quot;reward&quot; all of its correct guesses by confirming
them.  <strong>Classifier -&gt; Confirm all</strong> will add all of the automatically
classified glyphs on the page to the classifier as if they were
manually classified.</p>
<p><em>Again, don't forget to save the training data.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="and-another-page">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-11">And another page...</a></h1>
<p>For the sake of this tutorial, it will be assumed that some time has
lagged between training the second page and the third page, in order
to demonstrate how the training process can be continued.</p>
<p>Close Gamera and start it up again.  After opening the classifier
window, you can continue training by loading in the existing training
into the classifier using</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>File -&gt; Classifier glyphs -&gt; Open glyphs into classifier...</strong></blockquote>
<p>and loading the next image using</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Image -&gt; Open and segment image...</strong>.</blockquote>
<p>Training can then proceed as for the second page.  If all is going
well, each successive page should require less manual correction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="optimizing-the-classifier">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-12">Optimizing the classifier</a></h1>
<p>It is impossible to say how much training data is &quot;enough&quot;, and that
whole question is well beyond the scope of this tutorial.</p>
<p>When you have a representative amount of data collected, however, it
may be a good idea to optimize the classifier.  In short, optimization
involves deciding the relative weight (or importance) of each of the
features used for classification.</p>
<p>There are many ways to do this, but one that requires minimal manual
intervention is an optimizer based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA). Gamera
includes a GA for this purpose called <a class="reference external" href="ga_optimization.html">Biollante</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-end">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-13">The end</a></h1>
<p>That's the gist of training with Gamera.  Of course, there are a lot
more methodologies and tricks possible.  Enjoy!</p>
