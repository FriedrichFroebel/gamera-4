==============================
Building and installing Gamera
==============================

Linux (and other \*nix)
=======================

Prerequisites
-------------

- Python 3.5 and later are supported, though Python 3.7 is
  recommended.

  You will need to have the headers (but not the complete source) to
  build Gamera from source code.  Most Linux distributions include
  these as a separate package (eg. ``python-dev`` or ``python-devel``).

- python3-pip

- libgtk-3-dev

- ``gcc`` version 3.1 or later.

- libtiff 3.5.x or later

- libpng 1.2.x or later

- wxPython 4.0.x or later

If any of these prerequisites is installed in a non standard directory,
you can use the environment variables ``CFLAGS`` and ``LDFLAGS`` to
pass its locations to the build script, e.g.::

  CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
  LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
  export CFLAGS LDFLAGS


Standard Build and Install
--------------------------

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.  Open a
terminal and type::

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

By default, parallelization of the genetic algorithms is only compiled
into Gamera under Linux and with gcc version > 4.2, because we could only
get it running in this environment. If you are sure that you have unbroken
OpenMP support on your system, you can compile Gamera with::

  python setup.py build --openmp=yes

If Gamera is compiled with OpenMP on your system, but OpenMP does not work
on your system for some reason, you can switch it off with::

  python setup.py build --openmp=no


Installing without root privileges
----------------------------------

.. _without_root:

If you do not have root access to your machine, you can make a local
installation of Gamera.

A quick-and-easy way to do this is to use the ``virtual_python.py``
script available here__, and then follow the standard installation
instructions (without using sudo)::

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

.. __: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#creating-a-virtual-python

Alternatively, you can set up a local installation by hand.

Make a local python module directory somewhere that you have write
privileges (such as your home directory)::

  mkdir ~/python

From the Gamera build directory, install Gamera into that directory::

  python setup.py install --home=~/python

Set up an environment variables so Python can find stuff there (you
may want to add this to your ~/.bash_profile file)::

  export PYTHONPATH=~/python/lib/python

Add the local Python scripts directory to your path::

  export PATH=~/python/bin:$PATH

Now you should be able to run the ``gamera_gui`` script from the
command line.

Running
-------

Run the ``gamera_gui`` script, which should have installed to
``/usr/local/bin``.  This file can also be copied anywhere (such as
the Desktop) and double-clicked to run Gamera.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the compiled version of Gamera.

Installing without wxPython
---------------------------

When you need Gamera as a backend for document processing routines on
a server and do not need the GUI, it can save a lot of trouble to
avoid the installation of wxPython. For this case, use the option
``--nowx`` for ``setup.py``::

  python setup.py --nowx build
  sudo python setup.py --nowx install


Mac OS-X
========

Earlier versions of Gamera ran on OS-X by using X11 as an emulation of
a standard Unix environment.  The current SVN version of Gamera now
uses Cocoa, and feels much more like a standard Macintosh
application.  Please follow the instructions for *either* X11 or Cocoa
install below.


Native (Cocoa) build
--------------------

Prerequisites
`````````````

Gamera installs out of the box on Mac OS-X 10.11 (El Capitan) and later.
The only prerequisite is to install XCode, which is shipped with the
OS-X installation DVD, but is not installed by default.


Standard Build and Install
``````````````````````````

Gamera is built using the Python-standard Distutils system.

To build Gamera, open a terminal and type::

  python setup.py build

and then to install (you'll need to have admin privileges)::

  sudo python setup.py install

On OS-X 10.11, the script ``gamera_gui`` is installed to ``/usr/local/bin``,
which is also in the default search PATH for programs.


Installing without root privileges
``````````````````````````````````

The instructions for `installing without root (administrator)
privileges`__ can also be used on Mac OS-X.

__ without_root_

Running
```````

Start the Terminal application and run the ``gamera_gui`` script.

.. note:: Running the script from the root of the source tree will not
  work, since it will not be able to find the compiled version of
  Gamera.
